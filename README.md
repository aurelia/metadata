This library is part of the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform and contains utilities for reading and writing the metadata of JavaScript functions. It provides a consistent way of accessing type, annotation and origin metadata across a number of languages and formats. This library supports TypeScript metadata and contains helper functions that understand several simple, alternate locations and formats for metadata which are more easily leveraged by developers authoring code in plain ES6 or ES5.

## Platform Support

This library can be used in the **browser** as well as on the **server**.

## Building The Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

	```shell
	npm install
	```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

	```shell
	npm install -g gulp
	```
4. To build the code, you can now run:

	```shell
	gulp build
	```
5. You will find the compiled code in the `dist` folder, available in three module formats: AMD, CommonJS and ES6.

6. See `gulpfile.js` for other tasks related to generating the docs and linting.

## Running The Tests

To run the unit tests, first ensure that you have followed the steps above in order to install all dependencies and successfully build the library. Once you have done that, proceed with these additional steps:

1. Ensure that the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) CLI is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

	```shell
	npm install -g karma-cli
	```
2. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following commnand:

	```shell
	npm install -g jspm
	```
3. Download the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) module loader:

	```shell
	jspm dl-loader
	```

4. Ensure that you have Chrome installed. Karma runs the test suite in Chrome.

5. You can now run the tests with this command:

	```shell
	karma start
	```
